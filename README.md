# Disaster-Management-System
The disaster management system (DMS) seems like a smart tool that can help us better prepare for and respond to disasters. It uses technology to collect and organize important information such as where disasters occur, how strong they are, and the damage they cause. Using displays and simple maps, it helps people understand what to expect during an disaster and how to stay safe. DMS helps us respond to disaster together and keep everyone as safe as possible by ensuring everyone gets the right information at the right time.
